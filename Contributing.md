# Contributing

Please make all framework/plugin/theme/completions entries as a single line per entry. I let the GH markdown formatter take care of line breaks. This makes it easier to keep the entry sections sorted.

If you're submitting a theme, please try to make sure that the theme repo has a screen shot so that list users can tell what it looks like before installing it.

Thanks for the help, I appreciate all of the contributions.
