awesome-zsh-plugins
===================

Collection of zsh plugins inspired by the various awesome list collections out there.

# Frameworks

These frameworks make customizing your zsh setup easier.

* [antigen-hs](https://github.com/Tarrasch/antigen-hs) - A replacement for antigen optimized for a low overhead when starting up the shell.
* [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) - Antigen is a small set of functions that help you easily manage your shell (zsh) plugins, called bundles. The concept is pretty much the same as bundles in a typical vim+pathogen setup. Antigen is to zsh, what Vundle is to vim. Antigen can load oh-my-zsh themes and plugins.
* [dotzsh](https://github.com/dotphiles/dotzsh) - dotzsh strives to be platform and version independent, some functionality may be lost when running under older versions of zsh, but it should degrade cleanly and allow you to use the same setup on multiple machines of differing OS's without problems.
* [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) - A community-driven framework for managing your zsh configuration. Includes 120+ optional plugins (rails, git, OSX, hub, capistrano, brew, ant, macports, etc), over 120 themes to spice up your morning, and an auto-update tool so that makes it easy to keep up with the latest updates from the community.
* [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) - Prezto enriches the ZSH command line interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion, and prompt themes

# Plugins

* [adrien-f/docker-zsh](https://github.com/adrien-f/docker-zsh) - Adds tab completion for docker
* [oknowton/zsh-dwim](https://github.com/oknowton/zsh-dwim) - zsh-dwim attempts to predict what you will want to do next. It provides a key binding (control-u) that will replace the current (or previous) command line with the command you will want to run next.
* [tarrasch/zsh-autoenv](https://github.com/Tarrasch/zsh-autoenv) - If a directory contains a .env file, it will automatically be executed when you cd into it.
* [tarrasch/zsh-colors](https://github.com/Tarrasch/zsh-colors) - Makes it easier to colorize text from the CLI. `red foo` just works
* [tarruda/zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/tarruda/zsh-autosuggestions) - Fish-like autosuggestions for zsh
* [unixorn/autoupdate-antigen.zshplugin](https://github.com/unixorn/autoupdate-antigen.zshplugin) - Antigen doesn't do automatic updates like oh-my-zsh. This plugin adds auto updating for antigen, both of antigen and the bundles loaded in your configuration.
* [unixorn/git-extra-commands](https://github.com/unixorn/git-extra-commands) - Extra git helper scripts I've collected over time.
* [unixorn/rake-completion.zshplugin](https://github.com/unixorn/rake-completion.zshplugin) - Add tab completion for rakefile targets
* [voronkovich/mysql.plugin.zsh](https://github.com/voronkovich/mysql.plugin.zsh) - Adds some functions for dealing with mysql
* [zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search) - Needs to be loaded after zsh-syntax-highlighting. You'll also need to bind keys to its functions, details are in the README.md
* [zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) - Add syntax highlighting to your zsh. Make sure you load this _before_ zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search or they will both break

# Even more completions
* [zsh-users/zsh-completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions) is a collection of extra completions for zsh. To use it, add `antigen bundle zsh-users/zsh-completions src` to your .zshrc
* [RobSis/zsh-completion-generator](https://github.com/RobSis/zsh-completion-generator) - This plugin tries to read the list of options from the help text of programs and generate a completion function automatically. Load it last so it doesn't override completions provided by your other plugins.
