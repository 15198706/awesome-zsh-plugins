# Contributing

plugin/theme/completions entries should be on a single line, I let the GH markdown formatter take care of line breaks. This makes it easier to keep the entry sections sorted.

If you're submitting a theme, please make sure that the theme repo has a screen shot so that list users can tell what it looks like.

Thanks for the help, I appreciate all of the contributions.
